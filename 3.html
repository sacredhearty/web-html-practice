<h2>How to Become a Natural Language Processing engineer (with a degree of English language)</h2>
<p>1. Do the Masters or get another career<br>
If we’re serious about getting into this industry, a <strong>Masters</strong> in Computational Linguistics or Language Processing or Informatics is an absolute must if you are even remotely serious about moving into this industry.</p>
<p>2. Learn to code, do it now<br>
<u>Python</u> is popular but – in my experience – is rarely enough on its own.  Learning some <u>Java</u> or some <u>C++</u> and being able to demonstrate that you can use them effectively would give your prospects a serious boost.</p>
<p>3. Get some experience or build something…and then talk about it<br>
Built a PoS tagger?  Great!  Can I see it?  Developed a prototype ASR? Awesome.  Put a nice UI on it, get it hosted somewhere and tell us about it on your profile.</p>
<p>4. Look at the long term<br>
If you are prepared to be patient and invest in yourself then you’ll have a career at the cutting edge of tech and a very marketable skillset.</p>
